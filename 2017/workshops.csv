VISAP,VISAP,Adapted Dorling Cartogram on Wage Inequality in Portugal,Pedro Cruz,http://visap.uic.edu/2017/materials/Cruz-DorlingCartogram-visap117.pdf,"Wage inequality in Portugal has been systematically around 27%. This paper describes a set of animated cartograms that show this inequality for several years. The visualization was designed for an exhibition setting, and instead of presenting the final cartograms, it shows the cartogram formation for each year as a way of reiterating the message. The model used is a modification of Dorling cartograms that visually appears as a set of contiguous amalgams of total wages earned by subregion. This aspect confers an organic tone to the artifact, as if liquids of different densities were being poured into the canvas without mixing, and depicting a tension based behavior where amalgams of men and women push among themselves to compete for the same space.",,,,,,2017,2017,VISAP,101-ABC,Wednesday,VIS Arts Program - Papers Track - Session 1,8:30 AM,8:50 AM
VISAP,VISAP,Understanding People’s Interaction with Neural Sci-Art,"Manuela Garreton, Karina Hyland, and Denis Parra",http://visap.uic.edu/2017/materials/Garreton-NeuralSciArt-visap154.pdf,"Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience have discovered a complex neural network that activates when not performing a task. Every time the mind wanders and an inner conversation takes place, a series of brain regions work together to achieve some very important mental processes. These regions conform the default mode network (DMN), and its study has become critical for understanding how consciousness operates. With the intention to introduce this novel scientific finding to a non-expert audience and motivated by related works that combine science and art, we designed and implemented Default Stories: a work in progress of an interactive and immersive experience on the web. Using features of web interactive documentaries (i-docs), we present the main characteristics and relevance of the DMN in a language that can be understood by almost anyone. This website was published and available online for a month, where we collected navigation data (n=98) and analyzed the interaction between users and the interface. After this study, we were able to detect patterns on the interactions and intersect the findings with how the audience perceives and understands the presented subject. This work will serve as a starting point for new projects that present complex scientific research to non-expert public, by using interactive web experiences.",,,,,,2017,2017,VISAP,101-ABC,Wednesday,VIS Arts Program - Papers Track - Session 1,8:50 AM,9:10 AM
VISAP,VISAP,Visualizing Causes and Effects of California Sea Lion Unusual Mortality Event (UME),"Yoon Chung Han, Praful Surve, Subin Kim, and Josh Cuellar",http://visap.uic.edu/2017/materials/Han-CausesAndEffects-visap160.pdf,"This paper introduces our project Causes and Effects, which visualizes California sea lion unusual mortality events (UME) to create a new layer of understanding of the situation as an important environmental issue. It examines the causes of and impacts on sea lion UME by controlling multivariate factors that impact sea lions’ health and stranding. Previous visualizations for sea lion mortality only captured temporal data and the relationship between causes and effects using simple graphs. However, sea lion UME results from multiple causes and it requires multivariate visualization to establish clear solutions for future results. The resulting images of our visualization allow users to explore how environmental factors impact the lives and situations of sea lions.",,,,,,2017,2017,VISAP,101-ABC,Wednesday,VIS Arts Program - Papers Track - Session 1,9:10 AM,9:30 AM
VISAP,VISAP,Spatial Reliefs: Cross-Scale Space-Scapes,"Clarissa Ribeiro, Mick Lorusso, and Herbert Rocha",http://visap.uic.edu/2017/materials/Ribeiro-SpatialReliefs-visap184.pdf,"Conceived as a peaceful and playful exploration of interstellar space, this augmented reality and sound installation invites the audience to access the experiential dimension of space technologies and how the huge amount of data derived from space exploration can be accessed, appropriated, integrated into the artist’s poetics and experienced by the audience. The audience is invited to walk through a softly illuminated room where a few transparent cables come from the ceiling having small augmented reality markers in their extremities. Holding an iPad mini while exploring the space, one will find him/herself immersed in a soundscape populated with 3D models derived from actual micro scale images. The 3D models were generated via parametric design strategies from NASA’s Stardust Discovery-class mission’s database images of aerogel samples which have captured cosmic dust particles. The soundscape, or the soundtrack for navigating this Augmented Reality interstellar space, is a composition using a combination of sounds derived from images of identified stardust particles in nano scale from the same NASA mission. The installation is a tribute to Helio Oiticica’s radical series of red and ´ yellow ‘Spatial Reliefs’ (1960).",,,,,,2017,2017,VISAP,101-ABC,Thursday,VIS Arts Program - Papers Track - Session 2,8:30 AM,8:50 AM
VISAP,VISAP,Fiber Optic Ocean: Merging Media for Data Representation,Ozge Samanci and Adam Snyder,http://visap.uic.edu/2017/materials/Samanci-FiberOpticOcean-visap143.pdf,"This paper explores the interactive art installation, Fiber Optic Ocean, portraying the consequences of technology’s invasion of oceans. Three life-size shark skeletons are trapped in an ocean made of fiber optic threads. This 20-foot-by-20-foot installation combines fiber optics with sculptural elements and data-driven light and sound design. Data visualization and sonification emerge from the use of two data sets: human data (tweets per second) and shark data (speed of live sharks tagged with GPS). This paper examines the affordances and constraints of design with fiber optic threads. Using fiber optics in this media context expands the expressive opportunities for artists and creates a platform for representation of data.",,,,,,2017,2017,VISAP,101-ABC,Thursday,VIS Arts Program - Papers Track - Session 2,8:50 AM,9:10 AM
VISAP,VISAP,Using the Interaction Geography Slicer to Visualize New York City Stop & Frisk,"Ben Rydal Shapiro and Francis A. Pearman, II",http://visap.uic.edu/2017/materials/Shapiro-StopAndFrisk-visap147.pdf,"This paper adapts and uses a dynamic visualization environment called the Interaction Geography Slicer (IGS) developed by the 1st author to visualize data about New York City’s Stop & Frisk Program. Findings and discussion focus on how this environment provides new ways to view, interact with and query large-scale data sets over space and through time to support analyses of and public discussion about New York City’s Stop & Frisk Program.",,,,,,2017,2017,VISAP,101-ABC,Thursday,VIS Arts Program - Papers Track - Session 2,9:10 AM,9:30 AM
VISAP,VISAP,3D Visualization of Genetic Networks Using Diverse Art Materials,Jennifer Weiler and Kat Fowler,http://visap.uic.edu/2017/materials/Weiler-GeneticNetworks-visap150.pdf,"There has been growing interest in using artistic approaches to communicate scientific data. Most of this work has also taken advantage of new technology by incorporating digital and interactive media to convey complex or abstract concepts. In our work, we use these tools, data analysis and 3D printing, to explore means of representing genetic information using traditional art materials. From variations in DNA, we generate 3D models and used them as a basis for creating both a bronze sculpture and a low cost, tactilely-interactive piece. Looking forward, we are interested in understanding how viewers interpret data displays differently based on the type of materials used to construct the visualizations.",,,,,,2017,2017,VISAP,101-ABC,Thursday,VIS Arts Program - Papers Track - Session 2,9:30 AM,9:50 AM
